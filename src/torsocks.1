.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsocks
is a wrapper between the tsocks library and the application what you
would like to run socksified.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB[application\ \fB[application's\ arguments]]
run the application as specified with the environment (LD_PRELOAD) set
such that tsocks(8) will transparently proxy SOCKS connections in 
that program
.IP \fB[on|off]
this option adds or removes tsocks(8) from the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable. When tsocks(8) is in this variable all executed
applications are automatically socksified. If you want to
use this function, you HAVE to source the shell script from yours,
like this: "source /usr/bin/tsocks" or ". /usr/bin/tsocks"
.br
Example:
.br
". tsocks on" -- add the tsocks lib to LD_PRELOAD
.br
". tsocks off" -- remove the tsocks lib from LD_PRELOAD
.IP \fB[show|sh]
show the current value of the LD_PRELOAD variable
.IP \fB<without\ any\ argument>
create a new shell with LD_PRELOAD including tsocks(8).
