Original Installation Instructions For Tsocks
---------------------------------------------

1. Explenations of the ./configure options which might be of interest (and that are 
   specific to tsocks include):
	--disable-tordns	This option disables tordns, which causes
				names to be looked up in a way designed to
				work well with Tor.
	--enable-socksdns	This option causes tsocks to intercept
				DNS lookups and attempt to force them
				to use TCP instead of UDP and thus
				be proxied through the socks server. This
				is not a very elegant thing to do and
				should be avoided where possible.
	--disable-debug		This configuration option tells tsocks
				to never output error messages to stderr.
				This can also be achieved at run time
				by defining the environment variable
				TSOCKS_NO_ERROR to be "yes"
	--enable-oldmethod	This forces tsocks not to use the
				RTLD_NEXT parameter to dlsym to get the
				address of the connect() method tsocks
				overrides, instead it loads a reference
				to the libc shared library and then uses
				dlsym(). Again this is not very elegant
				and shouldn't be required.
	--enable-hostnames	This enables DNS lookups on names
				provided as socks servers in the config
				file. This option is not compatible with
				tordns or socks dns, since tsocks
				can't send a socks dns request to resolve
				the location of the socks server. 
	--with-conf=<filename>	You can specify the location of the tsocks
				configuration file using this option, it
				defaults to '/etc/tsocks.conf'

Other standard autoconf options are provided by typing './configure
--help'

2. Created files:

	- libtsocks.so - the libtsocks library
	- validateconf - a utility to verify the tsocks configuration file
	- inspectsocks - a utility to determine the version of a socks server
	- saveme - a statically linked utility to remove /etc/ld.so.preload
		   if it becomes corrupt
	- man pages - tsocks(8), tsocks(1) and tsocks.conf(5)

3. Configuration

You'll need to create the tsocks configuration file.
There are two samples provided in the build directory and 
/usr/local/share/examples/tsocks called 
tsocks.conf.simple.example and tsocks.conf.complex.example.
Documentation on the configuration file format is provided in the
tsocks.conf man page ('man tsocks.conf'). 

4. Having created the tsocks.conf file you should verify it using
validateconf (some detail on validateconf can be found in the tsocks.conf
man page). Normally validateconf is run without arguments
('./validateconf'). Any errors which are displayed by validateconf need
to be rectified before tsocks will function correctly.

5. You can now choose to make the library affect all users or just those
who choose to use it. If you want users to use it themselves, they can
simply use the tsocks(1) shell script to run programs (see 'man tsocks')
or do the following in their shell before running applications that need
to be transparently proxied:

	(in Bash) export LD_PRELOAD=<path to library>

	(in CSH) setenv LD_PRELOAD <path to library>

	<path to library> = e.g /usr/local/lib/tsocks/libtsocks.so.1.8

6. Go ahead and use it! At this point everything should work. Again, if
you experience any problems, use the contact points listed at
http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/contact.php. 

Thats it,
