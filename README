What is torsocks?
-----------------

Torsocks allows you to use most applications in a safe way with Tor. It ensures
that DNS requests are handled safely and explicitly rejects any traffic other
than TCP from the application you're using.

Torsocks is an ELF shared library that is loaded before all others. The library
overrides every needed Internet communication libc function calls such as
connect(2) or gethostbyname(3).

This process is transparent to the user and if torsocks detects any
communication that can't go through the Tor network such as UDP traffic, for
instance, the connection is denied. If, for any reason, there is no way for
torsocks to provide the Tor anonymity guarantee to your application, torsocks
will force the application to quit and stop everything.

Installation
-----------------

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

If you are compiling it from the git repository, run ./autogen.sh before the
configure script.

Using torsocks
--------------

Once you have installed torsocks, just launch it like so:

  $ torsocks [application]

So, for example you can use ssh to a some.ssh.com by doing:

  $ torsocks ssh username@some.ssh.com

You can use the torsocks library without the script provided:

  $ LD_PRELOAD=/full/path/to/libtorsocks.so your_app

For more details, please see the torsocks.1, torsocks.8 and torsocks.conf.5 man
pages. Also, you can use -h, --help for all the possible options of the
torsocks script.

A configuration file named *torsocks.conf* is also provided for the user to
control some parameters.
