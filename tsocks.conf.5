\- configuration file for tsocks(8)

.SH OVERVIEW

The configuration for tsocks can be anything from two lines to hundreds of 
lines based on the needs at any particular site. The basic idea is to define 
any networks the machine can access directly (i.e without the use of a 
SOCKS server) and define one or many SOCKS servers to be used to access
other networks (including a 'default' server). 

Local networks are declared using the 'local' keyword in the configuration 
file. When applications attempt to connect to machines in networks marked
as local tsocks will not attempt to use a SOCKS server to negotiate the 
connection.

Obviously if a connection is not to a locally accessible network it will need
to be proxied over a SOCKS server. However, many installations have several
different SOCKS servers to be used to access different internal (and external)
networks. For this reason the configuration file allows the definition of 
'paths' as well as a default SOCKS server. 

Paths are declared as blocks in the configuration file. That is, they begin
with a 'path {' line in the configuration file and end with a '}' line. Inside
this block directives should be used to declare a SOCKS server (as documented
later in this manual page) and 'reaches' directives should be used to declare 
networks and even destination ports in those networks that this server should 
be used to reach. N.B Each path MUST define a SOCKS server and contain one or 
more 'reaches' directives.

SOCKS server declaration directives that are not contained within a 'path' 
block define the default SOCKS server. If tsocks needs to connect to a machine
via a SOCKS server (i.e it isn't a network declared as 'local') and no 'path'
has declared it can reach that network via a 'reaches' directive this server 
is used to negotiate the connection. 

.SH CONFIGURATION SYNTAX

The basic structure of all lines in the configuration file is:

.RS
<directive> = <parameters>
.RE

The exception to this is 'path' blocks which look like:

.RS
path {
.RS
<directive> = <parameters>
.RE
}
.RE

Empty lines are ignored and all input on a line after a '#' character is 
ignored.

.SS DIRECTIVES 
The following directives are used in the tsocks configuration file:

.TP
.I server
The IP address of the SOCKS server (e.g "server = 10.1.4.253"). Only one
server may be specified per path block, or one outside a path
block (to define the default server). Unless --disable-hostnames was 
specified to configure at compile time the server can be specified as 
a hostname (e.g "server = socks.nec.com") 

.TP
.I server_port
The port on which the SOCKS server receives requests. Only one server_port
may be specified per path block, or one outside a path (for the default
server). This directive is not required if the server is on the
standard port (1080).

.TP
.I server_type
SOCKS version used by the server. Versions 4 and 5 are supported (but both
for only the connect operation).  The default is 4. Only one server_type
may be specified per path block, or one outside a path (for the default
server). 

You can use the inspectsocks utility to determine the type of server, see
the 'UTILITIES' section later in this manual page.

.TP
.I default_user
This specifies the default username to be used for username and password
authentication in SOCKS version 5. In order to determine the username to
use (if the socks server requires username and password authentication)
tsocks first looks for the environment variable TSOCKS_USERNAME, then
looks for this configuration option, then tries to get the local username.
This option is not valid for SOCKS version 4 servers. Only one default_user 
may be specified per path block, or one outside a path (for the default 
server)

.TP
.I default_pass
This specified the default password to be used for username and password
authentication in SOCKS version 5. In order to determine the password to
use (if the socks server requires username and password authentication)
tsocks first looks for the environment variable TSOCKS_PASSWORD, then
looks for this configuration option. This option is not valid for SOCKS
version 4 servers. Onle one default_pass may be specified per path block, 
or one outside a path (for the default server)

.TP
.I local
An IP/Subnet pair specifying a network which may be accessed directly without
proxying through a SOCKS server (e.g "local = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0"). 
Obviously all SOCKS server IP addresses must be in networks specified as 
local, otherwise tsocks would need a SOCKS server to reach SOCKS servers.

.TP
.I reaches
This directive is only valid inside a path block. Its parameter is formed
as IP[:startport[-endport]]/Subnet and it specifies a network (and a range
of ports on that network) that can be accessed by the SOCKS server specified
in this path block. For example, in a path block "reaches =
150.0.0.0:80-1024/255.0.0.0" indicates to tsocks that the SOCKS server 
specified in the current path block should be used to access any IPs in the 
range 150.0.0.0 to 150.255.255.255 when the connection request is for ports
80-1024.

.TP
.I tordns_enable
This enables the use of the 'tordns' feature in tsocks, which overrides the
standard C library name resolution calls to use SOCKS.    The default value is 
'true'. 

.TP
.I tordns_deadpool_range
Tor hidden sites do not have real IP addresses.  This specifies what range of 
IP addresses will be handed to the application as "cookies" for .onion names.  
Of course, you should pick a block of addresses which you aren't going to ever 
need to actually connect to. The default value is '127.0.69.0/255.255.255.0'.

.TP
.I tordns_cache_size
This specifies the number of IP addresses looked up through SOCKS to cache.
The default value is 256.  Each entry consumes 260 bytes of memory, so the
default adds 66,560 bytes of overhead to each 'torified' process. NOTE: if
the number of IP addresses in tordns_deadpool_range is less than the value
specified for tordns_cache_size, then the cache will be shrunk to fit the
deadpool range. This is to prevent duplicate deadpool addresses from ever
appearing in the cache. 

.SH UTILITIES
tsocks comes with two utilities that can be useful in creating and verifying
the tsocks configuration file. 

.TP
inspectsocks
inspectsocks can be used to determine the SOCKS version that a server supports.
Inspectsocks takes as its arguments the ip address/hostname of the SOCKS
server and optionally the port number for socks (e.g 'inspectsocks 
socks.nec.com 1080'). It then inspects that server to attempt to determine 
the version that server supports. 

.TP
validateconf
validateconf can be used to verify the configuration file. It checks the format
of the file and also the contents for errors. Having read the file it dumps 
the configuration to the screen in a formatted, readable manner. This can be 
extremely useful in debugging problems.

validateconf can read a configuration file from a location other than the 
location specified at compile time with the -f <filename> command line 
option.

Normally validateconf simply dumps the configuration read to the screen (in
a nicely readable format), however it also has a useful 'test' mode. When
passed a hostname/ip on the command line like -t <hostname/ip>, validateconf 
determines which of the SOCKS servers specified in the configuration file 
would be used by tsocks to access the specified host.
