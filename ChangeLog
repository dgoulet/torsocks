XXX
    o Added .travis.yml for travis-ci integration:

      https://travis-ci.org/ioerror/torsocks

Torsocks 1.3
2013-02-11 Jacob Appelbaum <jacob@appelbaum.net>

    o Issue 47: Invocation without argument is broken

      Added '--shell' as the documented way to spawn a shell with torsocks
      This removes the never working documented case where torsocks without
      arguments was supposed to spawn a shell.
      
    o Issue 48: Typos in manpage
      
      Updated man page to fix typos. 
      
    o Issue 37: Torsocks lets through tcp6 connections to tcp4 hosts

      Explicitly fail closed on connect() calls of AF_INET6 type
      Set errno to EAFNOSUPPORT in the IPv6 case.

    o Issue 33: LIBDIR hardcoded to /usr/lib, s/b/ /usr/lib64 on x86_64

      We now look for torsocks in /usr/lib and then /usr/lib64
      We assume that the first found is the correct one.

    o Issue 3: "... not found in any shared library. ..."
      
      This issue is extensively covered in the following bug report:
      http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=3
      
      Fixes provided by Lunar, Anthony Basile and Matthew Finkel

Torsocks 1.2
2011-10-28 Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>

    o Issue 32: Irssi locks connecting to hidden service
      
      During connect() we can end up getting a EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN while
      talking to the SOCKS proxy. This seems to happen when attempting
      to read a SOCKSV4 connect response from Tor when using the command
      'torsocks irssi -c 4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion' for example.
      
      EWOULDBLOCK isn't a valid error during connect(), so if we get it
      don't return it to the client - use EINPROGRESS instead.
      
      Diagnosed and patched by: foobi...@gmail.com


    o Issue 27: Fix build system so 'make dist' works
      
      "The current build system fails when trying to create a tarball using 'make dist'.
      There are two problems here:
      
      When creating a tarball for distribution with 'make dist', the header files at
      src/*.h are not included and so the build fails.  These should be listed in
      libtorsocks_la_SOURCES.
      
      Similarly, not having the prefix dist_ for the installation directories in doc/
      means that these will not be included in the distribution tarball.  Also, there
      is no need to define custom *manpagedirs as the build system is man page aware."
      
      Patch by Anthony Basile <blueness@gentoo.org>

    o Issue 29: tordns no worky? - Part 2
      
      This was a regression caused by splitting tsocks.c into socks.c and
      torsocks.c. The 'requests' and 'pool' variables were declared static in the socks.h
      header file with the result that the values were no longer shared between
      source files.
      
      Patch from foobi..@gmail.com

    o Issue 30: libtorsocks.so sanity check
      
      "Currently if libtorsocks.so doesn't exist, torsocks will happily proceed without it,
      and not use tor."
      
      Check for libtorsocks.so and bail out if it isn't found.

    o Issue 25: Building within a sandbox environment fails
      
      When building in a sandbox environment, the build system's substitution variable,
      @LD_PRELOAD@ is confused with the environment variable LD_PRELOAD and build fails
      with an error that it cannot load ld.so.
      
      By Renaming @LD_PRELOAD@ to @LDPRELOAD@, we disambiguate the two.
      
      Patch by: Athony Basile (blueness@gentoo.org)

    o Issue 26: common.h is a local header and should be included using #include "common.h"
      
      Patch by: Anthony G Basile (blueness@gentoo.org)

    o Clean up the build:
        Remove some cruft from Makefile.am
        Use $TORSOCKSLDFLAGS for libtorsocks and $TESTLDFLAGS
          for test/test_torsocks.
        Only run config.status once at configure time
        Add missing doc/Makefile.am
        Move patches directory to docs and update DEBUG readme
        Move man pages and configuration files to docs folder
        Clean up and comment configure.in
        Fix compile warning on some versions of gcc. Seen on 
          i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5659)
        Fix build on systems that export res_query a strange way
            Reported by starslights.
        Replace Makefile.cvs with autogen.sh
        Fix copyright notice
        Fix -lresolv on linux builds again
        Use @libdir@ instead of @prefix@ in src/Makefile.am
          Patch from Hicham Haouari.
          Fixes build for Fedora 64-bit.

    o Clean up the source tree:
        Add documentation to 'make dist'
        Fix funny malloc statement
        Split SOCKS functions into separate file
        Tidy up the file copyrights
        More renaming of tsocks to torsocks
        More whitespace cleanups
        Whitespace cleanup in parser.h
        Tidy up copyright in parser.h
        Rename functions from tsocks* to torsocks*
        Whitespace cleanups in common.c
        Rename tsocks.h to torsocks.h
        Rename tsocks.c to torsocks.c

    o Remove the supplementary utilities inspectsocks, saveme and validateconf
      as they've been disabled for some time now. They can be restored by popular demand if
      necessary.

    o Remove check that init() has been called
      I think the pthread_mutex takes care of this problem now.

    o Fix segfault    
      Occurred when tor not running, torsocks run in debug/test mode, and
      gethostbyaddr() fails.

    o Add a rudimentary test suite
        Make tests compile and run on OSX
        Compile and run tests on FreeBSD
        Make tests compile and run on OpenBSD

    o Compile and (apparently) work on OpenBSD

    o Remove socksdns, tordns and hostnames configure options.
      
      These options are defunct:
      1. socksdns (force dns lookups to use tcp)
          torsocks does this by default, no reason to make it optional.
      2. tordns (force dns lookups through tor)
          torsocks does this by default, option has been a no-op for a
          long time.
      3. hostnames (resolve name of socks server if required)
          potentially useful, but not really a good idea for tor.


    o Fix 'symbol res_send() was not found in any shared library'
      
      Solution found by Nicolas Pouillard (nicolas.pouillard@gmail.com).
      However I am still not clear why this is necessary for just this
      symbol on Linux.
      
      To test that it works:
      cd test/
      gcc -fPIC  -g -O2 -Wall -I. -o resinit resinit.c -lc -lresolv
      cd ..
      export TORSOCKS_DEBUG=2
      torsocks test/resinit
      Expected result:
      12:45:33 libtorsocks(21307): Got res_send request
      
      http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=3

    o Rename and clean up whitespace in the signature expansion header

    o Refuse connections to local network addresses.
      If a DNS request is made to a DNS server on a local network over
      TCP we need to reject it. So for now, reject all attempts to connect
      to servers on the local network using torsocks. If torsocks is used
      with programs that expect to use local network services - this will
      probably break them. I'm not aware of any.

    o Prevent execution of suid/sgid programs by torsocks
      We already do this in usewithtor. Closes off
      http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=5

Torsocks 1.1
2010-12-12 Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>
    o Handle wildcard addresses in getaddrinfo calls. Reported by Mike Perry.

    o Move the address inspection to the end of sendmsg() and sendto()
      so that we can exit early if the socket is not SOCK_STREAM (i.e.
      tcp).

    o Exit if Tor DNS is disabled.
      Exit with an error code if Tor DNS is disabled in the configuration
      or if we cannot reserve the deadpool address space for .onion
      addresses.

    o Always print error messages.

    o Allow error logging by default.

    o Style cleanup:
        No brackets for single-statement conditionals
        Whitespace fixes in tsocks.c
        Remove torsocks.kdevelop
        Remove non-free RFC and replace with link.
    o Remove USE_TOR_DNS compile guard
      This is a leftover from the tsocks days. We always want this option
      enabled.

    o Only enable debug output for debug builds
      Debug output was printing on release builds and getting suppressed
      on debug builds - which is the wrong way round!

    o Make a global variable less generic
      Exporting a global variable called 'progname' is not a good
      idea if you are a library. Exporting global variables at all
      is probably a bad idea.
      For now, make the name less generic - it was causing crashes
      when torsocks was used with dig.
      Part of the fix for:
          http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=15

    o Use socket rather than address to determine connection type
      In sendmsg() and sendto() we were inspecting the sock_addr_t
      structure to determine if the connection was Internet or not.
      Since msg->msg_name is an optional value in sendmsg() and
      sendto() this could result in crashes because we weren't ensuring
      it was non-null.
      Since it's optional we should have been inspecting the SO_DOMAIN
      of the connection's socket anyway - it will always be there.
      Part of the fix for:
      http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=15

    o Major refactor of symbol hooking
      Patch by alex@ohmantics.net
      Make torsocks fully compatible with Snow Leopard OSX.
      Slim down the symbol hooking code considerably.
      Alex's notes:
      "http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/releasenotes/Darwin/SymbolVariantsRelNotes/index.
      don't have the $UNIX2003 variants. For working 10.6 support, we'll need to
      conditionalize the UNIX2003 variants off when compiling for 64-bit."

    o Improve compile-time detection of the res* family of system calls
      Some platforms need to explicitly include resolv.h so cater for
      that.
      Thanks to SwissTorExit for reporting and debugging assistance.

    o Do our best to ensure tsocks_init is called only once.

    o Build fix for BSD.
      Support presence of res_query in libc rather than libresolve.

Torsocks 1.0-epsilon
2009-11-01 Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>

    o Manpage syntax fixes from Patrick Matthäi <pmatthaei@debian.org>

    o Clarify use of the configuration file.

      Amend the default behaviour to work as summarized below and updated the
      manual pages to make the default behaviour obvious to users.

      "By default, torsocks will assume that it should connect to the SOCKS proxy
      running at 127.0.0.1 on port 9050. This is the default address and port for
      Tor's socks server on most installations.

      In order to use a configuration file, you must set the environment variable
      TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE with the location of the file.

      If TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE is not set, torsocks will attempt to read the configuration
      file at @CONFDIR@/torsocks.conf. If that file cannot be read, torsocks will
      use sensible defaults for most Tor installations, i.e. it will assume that
      you want to use a SOCKS proxy running at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 9050."

    o Fix compilation in 64-bit OSX.

    o Mac OSX compatibility in tsocks.c
      Original Patch from Alex Rosenberg <alex@ohmantics.com>

        1. Hook OSX-specific syscalls
        -----------------------------
          Mac OXS has a number of variants of each syscall. This patch adds
          hooks for the following OSX variants:

            select() : select_unix2003()
                      select_nocancel()
                      select_darwinextsn_nocancel()
                      select_darwinextsn()

            poll(), connect(), sendmsg(), sendto(), close(): *_unix2003(),
                                                            *_nocancel()
            getpeername(): *_unix2003()

        2. Add Hooking Macros
        --------------------
          Move the symbol loading and checking out to macros of the form
          [syscall]_PATCH:

            PATCH_SELECT, PATCH_CONNECT, PATCH_CLOSE, PATCH_POLL,
            PATCH_GETPEERNAME, PATCH_SENDTO, PATCH_SENDMSG

          Rename the syshooks to functions of the form *_guts().

        3. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
          Add NONSTD_SOURCE define for Mac OSX.Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE
          causes library and kernel calls to behave as closely
          to Mac OS X 10.3's library and kernel calls as possible.

          Use socklen_t instead of int.

          Move get_environment() and get_config() to tsocks_init(),
          rather than calling adhoc in the syscalls.

          Differentiate between EISCONN and EINPROGRESS errors in
          connect().

        Original Patch from Alex Rosenberg <alex@ohmantics.com>
        http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=2#c11

    o Patch torsocks.in for Mac OSX
        Patch from alexr@ohmantics.com
        Mac OSX uses the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES and DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE
        environment variables to enable/perform syscall-hooking. Also, on
        Mac OSX dynamically linked libraries use the '*.dylib' extension
        rather than '*.so'. Alex's patches for torsocks.in and configure.in
        ensure that we use the appropriate values for Max OSX. Ideally, we
        wouldn't export DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE on non-Mac OSX platforms
        but it is harmless to do so. We'll leave that for another day.
        The patch also fixes up the sed reg-exp to interpret the 'echo
        DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES' output as well as that from LD_PRELOAD.

    o Whitespace cleanup in parser.c

    o Add linker checks for Mac OSX. Patch from alexr@ohmantics.com

    o Move MAP_ANONYMOUS to common.h

    o LD_PRELOAD is ignored for binaries where setuid/gid is used. As used,
      torsocks doesn't detect this, which means that it provides a false sense
      of security when running these types of executables.
      Added logic that detects setuid/setgid programs and fails early with an
      error message.
      Further reorganized the file to simplify flow and improve command line
      argument handling.
      Patch by Marcus Griep <marcus@griep.us>

    o remove aclocal.m4

    o BSD build patch from grarpamp. See http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=4.

    o Replace TSOCKS_* environment variables with TORSOCKS_* equivalents as per man page.

    o Remove superfluous include.

    o Fix compilcation on Mac OSX. See http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/detail?id=2

    o Expand reject message for UDP and ICMP requests

Torsocks 1.0-delta
2009-02-XX Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>
    o Fix segfault when address supplied for getaddrinfo is null. Reported by Mike Perry.
    o Handle wildcard addresses in getaddrinfo calls. Reported by Mike Perry.

Torsocks 1.0-gamma
2009-01-22 Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>
    o Fix issue with poll(). We were looking for READ events rather than
      POLLIN events. Reported by Mike Perry.
    o Handle premature call of symbols before pre-loaded.
      Reported by Mike Perry using 'torsocks svn' on Fedora 10.
    o Catch res_query, res_search, res_querydomain, and res_send and
      try to ensure DNS requests using these API calls are transmitted
      via TCP rather than UDP.
    o Reject even locally-destined UDP messages, since these may be
      DNS requests to a DNS proxy on an DSL router.
    o Ensure torsocks.conf is in the expected place.
    o Match tor's list of local subnets both in torsocks.conf and by
      default.
    o Ignore non-INET streams. Reject INET UDP streams. We were previously
      rejecting anything that wasn't an INET stream, this prevented connect
      calls of the PF_FILE type by applications such as xchat. Is there a
      security issue here - applications bypassing TCP to leak user info?

Torsocks 1.0-beta
2008-10-26 Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net>
